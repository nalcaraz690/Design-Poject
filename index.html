            <p class="p2">For this project, I had to create my own original website on anything of my choice. I struggled a lot at first to come up with an idea that would insipre me and motivate me to work hard and perfect my websiote. I finally decided I'd make a site on my three favorite stores in Fairview that you can click on below to my favorite articles in their store. <i>(The pictures in the header can also be clicked to send you to their proper website)</i></p>

        <p class="p">I hope this website inspires you and possibly sparks some new creative ideas in your fashion. Each store has their pros and cons, between quality and price, I feel these three stores compliment each other pretty well. After scrolling through the catalogue of each store's articles, it would be much appreiacted for you to fill out the quick and easy form for me to know what I could include next time or ameliorate my website. It will be found at the bottom of the page, along with the About Me and Why I Decided To Make This Site sections. Thank you!</p>

                    <p class="aboutp">I am a grade 9 student in St. Thomas High School currently taking coding class. This website was an assingment where I had to make a website on my own on something special to me. I much enjoyed the process, even through its challenging moments, as this is what made the resulting product so satisfying.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="whyp">At first, I was torn on what subject to make my website on. I couldn't figure out what inspired me, and once I found some ideas, I couln't decide between them. Finally, I figured that since I've always tried to dress nicely even though some clothes can be extremely expensive, I wanted to make a website on my favourite stores. Although some products are extremely expensive, there are still some of my favorite out there and that was why I included them. Thank you!</p>
